# AMMA CMS Portal - Multi-User Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Portal Renamed**
- Changed from "Staff Portal" to "AMMA CMS Portal" throughout the application
- Updated all templates, titles, and navigation text
- Clear distinction: Staff Members (data) ≠ Portal Users (people who log in)

### 2. **Permission System**
Created custom permissions for granular access control:
- `can_manage_news` - Manage news articles
- `can_manage_services` - Manage services
- `can_manage_projects` - Manage projects (for future use)

### 3. **Access Control**
- **Middleware**: Blocks non-superusers from accessing `/admin/`
- **Decorators**: Permission-based view protection
- **Context Processors**: Makes permissions available in all templates
- **Navigation**: Menu items show/hide based on user permissions

### 4. **User Management**
Portal users are managed through Django admin panel:
- You (superuser) create portal users
- Portal users have `is_staff=True` but `is_superuser=False`
- Permissions assigned individually or via groups
- Portal users CANNOT access Django admin panel

## Files Created

### New Files
1. `apps/staff_portal/permissions.py` - Permission definitions and check functions
2. `apps/staff_portal/middleware.py` - Middleware to block admin access
3. `apps/staff_portal/context_processors.py` - Template context for permissions
4. `apps/staff_portal/migrations/0001_add_portal_permissions.py` - Database migration
5. `PORTAL_USERS_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive user guide
6. `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `apps/staff_portal/decorators.py` - Added permission decorators
2. `apps/staff_portal/views.py` - Added permission checks to all views
3. `config/settings.py` - Registered middleware and context processor
4. `templates/staff_portal/base.html` - Updated branding and navigation
5. `templates/staff_portal/dashboard.html` - Added permission-based UI

## How It Works

### For You (Superuser)
1. Log in to `/admin/`
2. Create new users under "Users"
3. Set `is_staff=True` and `is_superuser=False`
4. Assign permissions: `Can manage news`, `Can manage services`, etc.
5. Portal users can now log in to `/portal/`

### For Portal Users
1. Go to `/admin/login/`
2. Enter credentials
3. Automatically redirected to `/portal/` dashboard
4. See only sections they have permission for
5. Cannot access `/admin/` - they get redirected with a warning

### Permission Flow
```
User logs in → Middleware checks superuser status
                ↓
                Is superuser?
                ↓
        Yes ────┴──── No
        │              │
    Access /admin/   Redirect to /portal/
        │              │
        │        Check permissions
        │              ↓
        │        Show allowed sections only
```

## Testing Checklist

### Create a Test Portal User
- [ ] Go to Django admin
- [ ] Create new user with:
  - Username: `testportal`
  - Password: (your choice)
  - Staff status: ✅ Checked
  - Superuser status: ❌ Unchecked
  - Permission: `Can manage news articles`

### Test Access Control
- [ ] Log in as test user at `/admin/login/`
- [ ] Verify redirected to `/portal/`
- [ ] Try accessing `/admin/` - should be blocked
- [ ] Verify "News" appears in navigation
- [ ] Verify "Services" does NOT appear (no permission)
- [ ] Can create/edit news articles
- [ ] Cannot access service management

### Test Superuser
- [ ] Log in as superuser
- [ ] Can access `/admin/`
- [ ] Can access `/portal/`
- [ ] See all sections in portal navigation
- [ ] Can manage everything

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. **Create Your First Portal User**
   - Follow the guide in `PORTAL_USERS_GUIDE.md`
   - Test all permissions

2. **Set Up User Groups (Optional)**
   - Create groups for common permission sets
   - Example: "News Editors", "Service Managers", "Content Managers"

3. **Update Your Documentation**
   - Share `PORTAL_USERS_GUIDE.md` with team members
   - Document your specific workflows

4. **Security Best Practices**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Regular permission audits
   - Keep superuser accounts minimal

### Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Password reset via email
- User activity logging
- Content approval workflows
- Role-based templates
- Projects management (permission already created)

## Technical Architecture

### Permission Model
```python
# Custom permissions attached to auth.Group content type
Permission(
    codename='can_manage_news',
    name='Can manage news articles',
    content_type=ContentType(auth.group)
)
```

### Decorator Usage
```python
@news_permission_required
def news_create(request):
    # Only users with can_manage_news permission can access
    ...
```

### Template Context
```django
{% if can_manage_news %}
    <a href="{% url 'staff_portal:news_list' %}">News</a>
{% endif %}
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this implementation:

```bash
# Rollback migration
python manage.py migrate staff_portal zero

# Remove files (optional)
rm apps/staff_portal/permissions.py
rm apps/staff_portal/middleware.py
rm apps/staff_portal/context_processors.py
```

Then manually revert changes in:
- `config/settings.py` (middleware and context processor)
- `apps/staff_portal/decorators.py`
- `apps/staff_portal/views.py`
- Template files

---

## Support

All code changes have been tested with:
- `python manage.py check` - No errors
- Migration applied successfully
- Permission system active

For questions or issues, refer to:
1. `PORTAL_USERS_GUIDE.md` - User management instructions
2. Code comments in modified files
3. Django documentation on permissions

## Summary

**What you can do now:**
- Create multiple portal users via Django admin
- Assign specific permissions (news, services, projects)
- Portal users can manage content but NOT access admin panel
- Only you (superuser) can access Django admin
- Clear separation between website staff data and portal users

**Key Benefits:**
- Secure multi-user content management
- Permission-based access control
- No admin panel access for portal users
- Easy to manage via Django admin
- Scalable for future features
